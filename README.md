A Universal GPU Driver Development Kit contains Modules to build Low Level Graphics Engines and Drivers for your GPU. The Core Module is the AsteriskGL Component that you can create out of AsteriskGL Modules.

## Standards and Driver
The History of Graphics Card Drivers and Standards is long and complex we clean the dust. We are working on Platform Arch Indipendent Modular Drivers for NVIDIA, AMD, Intel. with Full *GL Support we call our GL implementation AsteriskGL as also short AGL or on text *GL

This is mainly build up on the Results and Research of LLVMpipe and Gallium as also libMESA3d
